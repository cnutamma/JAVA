Insertion sort:
            In this sorting tecnique first we will divide array into two parts 
            1)sorted path
            2)unsorted path
            we will take an element from the unsorted path and fix that element in which thier place in the sorted path.

Example:
7 8 3 1 2

iteration 1: 7 as sorted element and remaning all are unsorted 
             now comapare 7 with 8
             7 8|3 1 2
iteration 2:now here 7,8 are sorted elements and remaning are unsorted
            now compare sorted elements with 3
            3 7 8 |1 2
iteration 3:Now here 3,7,8 are sorted elements and remaning are unsorted
            compare sorted elements with 1
            1 3 7 8 |2
iteration 4:Now here 1,3,7,8 are sorted elements and remaning are unsorted
            comapare sorted elements with 2
            1 2 3 7 8
